## Architecture

### MVP

- Information about MVP can be found at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter>. The reason behind this architecture decision is to make sure view controllers are light weight and easy to understand.

## Code coverage

- Code coverage is at %53. It could be much higher but because of time limitations, only test what i found most important. Pretty printed code coverage file can be found in the repository.

## Things i would have done

Because of time limitations, there are some decisions that would have been different.

- Using NSUserDefaults for storing searched cities, normally i would have used database for this.
- Storing the weather information class as it is in user defaults. I would have created a smaller structure inside of weather information structure and just store that.
- Lack of dependency injection for view controllers. I personally prefer using coordinator pattern to overcome this but did not have time to implement.
- Lack of network layer. Right now, there is no separate network layer and it is inside current city weather manager.
